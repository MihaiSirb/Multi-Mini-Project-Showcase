**Description:**
The Multi-Mini Project Showcase is a GitHub repository containing several mini projects aimed at honing various frontend development skills. Each mini project focuses on a specific aspect or functionality commonly encountered in frontend development. Some of the mini projects included in this repository are:

1. **Weight Converter:** A simple web application that allows users to convert weights between different units.
