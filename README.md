**Multi-Mini Project Showcase**

**Description:**
The Multi-Mini Project Showcase is a GitHub repository containing several mini projects aimed at honing various frontend development skills. Each mini project focuses on a specific aspect or functionality commonly encountered in frontend development. Some of the mini projects included in this repository are:

1. **Weight Converter:** A simple web application that allows users to convert weights between different units.
2. **Snake Login Form:** An interactive login form inspired by the classic game "Snake," where users can input their credentials in a fun and engaging manner.
3. **Password Validator:** A tool for validating the strength of passwords entered by users, providing feedback on factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

These mini projects serve as practical exercises for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as exploring frontend frameworks and libraries where applicable. By working on these projects, I aim to enhance my proficiency in frontend development and learn new techniques to create intuitive and user-friendly web experiences.
